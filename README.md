# PersonalAngularSite

This project is a side hobby being worked on over the course of Summer 2023 while working full-time. If you discover any bugs or have any questions at all, feel free to email me at mcorbishley@wisc.edu

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelc143/personal-angular-site
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd personal-angular-site
```
3. Install the necessary dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the development server
```bash
ng serve
```
5. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to access the website.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

To execute the unit tests for this web app, run the following command:
```bash
ng test
```

If you want to run the unit tests without opening a chrome window, run the following command
```bash
ng test --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless
```

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
